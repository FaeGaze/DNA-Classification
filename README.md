DNA Sequence Classification Using Machine Learning
The objective of this project is to explore how well traditional and ensemble learning models perform on sequence classification tasks, particularly in the context of genomic data.This project focuses on the classification of short Escherichia coli (E. coli) DNA sequences using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises 106 DNA sequences, each consisting of 57 sequential nucleotides (base pairs).

To evaluate the effectiveness of different classification algorithms, the following models were trained and tested:

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Linear Kernel

AdaBoost Classifier

Each model was evaluated based on its accuracy score and detailed classification report (precision, recall, F1-score). The results provide insights into which algorithm performs best in identifying patterns within biological sequence data and generalizes most effectively to unseen samples.
